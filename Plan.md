# Idea for proof assistant
## A regex-based string manipulator.

Simple plan
- Define special characters for the operators.
- Define characters for the propositions / variables.
- Define Regexes for the substitution rules.
- Define Data-Types for axioms and theorems.
- Use AI problem solving agent to explore theorems.

Rules for “interesting” theorems(?)
- They are short
- They are very connected
- They are close to the axioms.

Start with ~~propositional logic~~ MU system, then propositional logic.
